First Form

Each Column in your table can only have 1 value.

Ex. You should not have an address column in your table that lists the address, city, state, and zip, all separated by commas.

Second Form
Each Column in your table that is not a key (primary or foreign) must have unique values.

Ex. If you have a movies table with a categories column, you should not have a category repeated more than once.

Third Form
You cannot have a non-key column that is dependent on another non-key column.

Ex. If you have a books table with columns publisher_name and publisher_address, the publisher_address and publisher_name should be separated into a separate table and linked to books with a foreign key. The publisher_address is dependent on the publisher_name and neither column is a key column.

Database Conventions

• make the table name plural and ALL lowercase - make it plural (ex. users, leads, sites, clients, chapters, courses, modules)
• use "id" as the primary key - name it id (also make it auto-incremented).
• name foreign keys with singular_table_name_id when referencing to a primary key in another table name it [singular name of the table you're referring to]_id (ex. user_id, lead_id, site_id, client_id, chapter_id, course_id, module_id).
• use created_at and updated_at as columns for the timestamp in EVERY table you create.



Data Types
The following are the data types that you will be using 95% of the time. Although there are quite a few other data types that you can use, focus on these for now.

Simple Data Types:
• VARCHAR(number of characters)
  • Used to store non-numeric values that can be up to 255 characters. It is called a VARCHAR because it can store a variable number of characters and will only use the space required for each record that is stored in the database. VARCHAR should be used for values with different character lengths like an email, first_name, or last_name.

• CHAR(number of characters)
  • Also used to store non-numeric values, however, it will use up all space for the set number of characters regardless of what value is added. For instance, if I set CHAR(15), and I try to store the value "Coding", it will use up the equivalent of 15 characters even though "Coding" is only 6 characters long. Char is good to use for things that will always be a given number of characters. Char would work well for something like a state_abbreviation.

• INT
  • Used to store integers.
  • The columns that you will find mostly using the INT are things like a unique identifier for each table. The majority of rows in a table will not exceed 2.1 billion records. INT is good to use for most normal number values like a phone_number or a zip_code.
  • unsigned (positive numbers only) - can store numerical values from 0 up to 4294967295
  • signed (positive and negative numbers) - can store numerical values from -2147483648 up to 2147483647

• BIGINT
  • BIGINT would be used for columns that would need to store huge numbers. In most cases, you wouldn't need BIGINT, but if you wanted to store something like a Facebook id when using Facebook's API, since they have over a billion users the id will need to be a data type of BIGINT.
  • unsigned (again positive numbers only) - can store numerical values from 0 up to 18446744073709551615
  • signed (positive and negative numbers) - can store numerical values from 9223372036854775807 to -9223372036854775808.


• TINYINT
  • TINYINT would be good to use for numbers that will be relatively small. A good example of something that would use a TINYINT is user level identifier (0 - inactive user, 1 - active user, 9 - admin).
  • unsigned - can store numerical values from 0 up to 255
  • signed - can store numerical values from -128 up to 127

• FLOAT
  • Used to store floating point numbers (numbers that need to have decimal places). An example column for this would be like an item_cost.
• TEXT
  • Used to store a large amount of text, like a description, message, or comment. Use this for any text that VARCHAR() is too small to handle.
• DATETIME
  • used to store a date and time in the format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
